# Lab 3 Element Counter

This lab adds the ability to analyze your "about me" 
website by allowing the user to check the type of elements 
they would like to count. When they click a button, your new code
will provide element counts for the selected elements

## Branch

Make a branch for today's lab!

```sh
> git checkout -b element-count
```

## Tools

* For today, skip the form and just use checkboxes and a button
* Use `document.querySelectorAll` to get the list of checked checkboxes
* For each checked checkbox, use the associate value (`p`, `input`, `div`, etc.) to do
another `document.querySelectorAll` to find how many of those elements are in the document.
(HINT: you just need the `.length` of the returned `NodeList`).
* Report back to the user the list of elements and respective counts

## Steps

### Create checkboxes and a button

1. Start by creating a series of checkboxes that all have the
same name and each one has a value indicating what tag name in represents (`p`,
`section`, `input`, etc). Try and include a broad set of tag names. Each checkbox
should also have an associated label to visually show the user the corresponding tag name)

2. Create a function in a stand alone `.js` file and log a message to let you know the function fired

3. Wire the `onclick` of the button to call the function and validate that it logs the message

### Gather the selected checkboxes, analyze DOM, set results

In your function, get a list of all the checked checkboxes, for example:
```js
var tags = document.querySelectorAll('input[name="tags"]:checked');
```

Create your response text as you are looping through the list of checked tags

1. Get the value of the checkbox by calling `tags[i].value` and
store in a `tag` variable
1. Call `document.querySelectorAll(tag)` and add the `tag` and `length` of the returned
query into your response text

Response text might look like: 

```
p - 5
section - 2
```

If you use a `<pre>` tag as your target, you can use `\n` to add a newline to your text. Otherwise,
you can also build `html`, but you'll need to set your target response element using `.innerHTML =` instead
of `.textContent =`

## Stretch

SRP, or Single Responsibility Principal, means the we like things to do one and only one things. In this case, 
we are going to build up a dictionary of results, then have a second step to go through the diction and build up
the response text
     
1. Create an empty object variable `tagCount` to which you can add properties
1. Loop the `tags` and for each one:
    1. Get the value of the checkbox by calling `tags[i].value` and
    store in a `tag` variable
    1. Call `document.querySelectorAll(tag)` and store the list in a variable (like `list`)
    1. Store the length of the list in a new property whose key is the tag name: `tagCount[tag] = list.length;`
1. After looping through, console log `tagCount` and check that the value looks correct
1. Create a variable `html` whose value is: `<ul>`
1. Get a list of all of the keys in your `tagCount` by using:
     ```js
     var keys = Object.keys(tagCount);
     ```
1. Loop the `keys` again, and for each `key` (`keys[i]`):
    1. Get the count property value off `tags` using the key
    2. Append a string to `html` that is html for a `li` that has tag a count as text, for example:
        ```html
        <li>p 15</li>
        ```
1. Add the closing `</ul>` to `html`
1. Assign `html` as the `.innerHTML` of the element in which you are going to display the results
